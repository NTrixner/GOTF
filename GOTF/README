# GOTF
## The Generic, Open Tabletop Framework

This is the generic, open tabletop framework.
This framework was designed to create TTRPG rules systems that follow the GAPOI structure (Game Modes, Attributes, Perks, Origins, and Inventory).
It was inspired by the licensing actions of certain TTRPG companies during the last years.
The GOTF is completely open and developed under the WTFPL (The Do What the Fuck you want public license).
You can do with the GOTF whatever the fuck you want. Copy it, modify it, sell it, produce homebrew content for it.
For an example of a GOTF-based system, check out the GOTF Fantasy (https://github.com/NTrixner/GOTFFantasy)
