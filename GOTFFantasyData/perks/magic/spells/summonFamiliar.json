      "When casting Summon Familiar instead of Summon Soul on a soul shard, you do not summon it.",
      "Instead, you bind the soul to become your familiar.",
      "From then on, whenever you summon that soul, it can deliver melee spell attacks, and spells which require you touching someone or something, instead of you.",
      "However, doing so costs 2 AP, and you have to concentrate on the spell until the Familiar acts.",
      "It uses your statistics to deliver melee spell attacks.",
      "You can also spend 1 to 5 Mana per Minute - depending on the Soul Shard Size - to enter a trance and perceive anything that the Familiar perceives.",
      "The Familiar follows your mental commands, and the soul it is bound to is not shattered when it dies.",
      "Instead, if a familiar dies, your Maximum Mana is reduced by the amount you paid to summon it.",
      "This reduction lasts for 10 days, and you can not bind a new soul to be your familiar until then.",
      "When you cast Summon Familiar on another soul while having a familiar, the first loses its status as familiar, and the new soul becomes your familiar."
