\section{Half-Orcs}\label{species:half-orcs}
Half-Elves are the result of a relationship between a human and an orc.
Oftentimes, this results in them feeling not very at home in either of those two societies.\\
Half-Orcs mature at the age of 12, and can live to 50.\\
At their best, Half-Orcs are reliable, mindful and tenacious\\
At their worst, they are too direct, quick to anger and rough.\\
Half-Orcs start with a \textbf{Racial Bonus to Strength of +2} as well as a \textbf{Racial Bonus of +1 to a different active Attribute}.\\
As part of their orcish heritage, they also gain the ability to \textbf{Fall to 1 Health instead of 0 once every 24 hours}.\\
Half-Orcs start the game with 25 Health, 30 Stamina, 15 Mana and 20 Faith.
