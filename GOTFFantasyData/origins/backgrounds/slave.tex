\section{Slave}\label{background:slave}
Having lived a life of oppression, you're a former or current slave â€” somehow still bearing the weight of shackles, whether physical or metaphorical.
Your journey embraces the pursuit of freedom, self-discovery, or a yearning for justice.
With chains of various forms now guiding your path, you navigate uncharted territories with an unwavering resolve.

Adventures might be pursued to liberate others from their chains, to reclaim a lost sense of identity, or to challenge the forces that still seek to keep you confined.
Your resourcefulness and inner strength, forged through adversity, equip you to navigate a range of challenges.

Yet, even as you walk a new path, the echoes of your past linger.
Physical restraints, emotional scars, or unresolved vendettas might entwine with your motivations.

Your goals encompass liberation, self-empowerment, confronting the shadows of your history, or even dismantling the systems that perpetuate oppression.
Adventure becomes your battleground for reclaiming your agency and rewriting the narrative of your life.
Will you break free from your shackles, find solace within your scars, or rise as a symbol of resistance against injustice?
The journey ahead is a tapestry you weave anew.
