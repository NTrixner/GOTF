\textbf{Spell, Active, Repeatable, Source, Memory}\\
For 3 AP and 4 Mana you lower the temperature of your hand to a freezing point.
Keeping this effect up takes 1 Mana per AP.
When you touch an object or a creature, you can decide if you want to lower their temperature gradually or aggressively.\\
If you lower someone's or something's temperature gradually, you can do so at a rate of about 1 degree Celsius or 1 Kelvin per 5 AP.\\
If you do so aggressively, make a melee magic weapon attack against that target.
On a hit, the Ice Touch deals 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 Stamina damage.
After the damage is dealt from aggressive cooling, the spell ends.
