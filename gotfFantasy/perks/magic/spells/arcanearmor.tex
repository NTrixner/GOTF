\subsection{Variation: Elemental Armor}\label{spell:elementalArmor}
\textbf{Cost:} 50 LP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
When casting Elemental Armor instead of Arcane Armor, the armor instead grants Armor Reduction against elemental damage types.
Pay the Mana casting cost for each damage type that the Elemental Armor should defend against.\\
For example, a rank II Elemental Armor that defends against Heat and Cold, the casting cost would be 20 Mana, and it would grant Heat and Cold Resistance 4.\\
A creature can benefit from multiple different Elemental and Arcane Armors at a time, but the effects don't stack.
Instead, only the highest gained Damage Reduction per Damage Type applies.
