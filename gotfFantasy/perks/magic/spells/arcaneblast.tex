You can create a blast of magic energy at a point in a range of 30m around you.
This takes 3 AP and 15 Mana.
Any creature in a radius of 5m around your chosen point takes 4d8 blunt damage and must make a Strength check, contested by your Intellect Check.
If they fail, they are pushed 1.5m away from the point of origin of the blast, and fall prone.
