For 3 AP you can create a small Orb of Light that shines a bright light for a radius of 5m.
Beyond that, the light fades into dim light for a radius of 5m.
Beyond that, darkness still prevails.
The Orb is the size of your hand, and you can control its position telepathically.
However, it can not move further away than 30m from you.
You can decide the colour of the orb and change it at any time. \\
Keeping the Orb of Light up costs 1 Mana per 10 Minutes.
