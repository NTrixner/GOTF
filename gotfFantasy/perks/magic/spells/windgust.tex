For 2 AP and 4 Mana, you can create a small gust of wind in a range of 35m.
This gust is strong enough to blow out candles, but makes larger fires only flicker.
You can also use it to move very light, small objects, like pieces of paper or feathers at a speed of 1.5m per AP.
For every AP that you keep up this Wind Gust, you must pay 1 Mana.
