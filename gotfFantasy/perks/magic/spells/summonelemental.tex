\section{Summon Elemental}\label{spell:summonElemental}
\textbf{Cost:} 250 LP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} \\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Repeating, Source, Memory}\\
You cast for 4 AP and 5 Mana and summon forth a Combat Tier 1 elemental from one of the four prime elemental planes.
The elemental follows your mental commands, but you can only command it if you're able to perceive it.\\
The summon disappears after 1 minute, until it is slain, or until you dismiss it.
If your memory is interrupted, or if you chose to relinquish control over the elemental, the elemental goes rogue.
As a result, you can not command it anymore, and it starts attacking indiscriminately.
A summoned elemental that has become rogue stays until the spell runs out.
