When targeted by magic that would deal damage to you, you can block that magic.
Doing so requires a block roll that uses your INT, as well as an amount of Mana (instead of Stamina) equal to 2 per AP that the Attacker used.
If you succeed, you reduce the spell damage dealt by 1d6.
The amount blocked like this improves from the~\nameref{perk:spellpowertraining} perk.
This action counts as a defensive Action for all other related perks.
