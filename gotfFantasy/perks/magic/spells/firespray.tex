You cast for 3 AP and 4 Mana.
Fire shoots forth from your fingertips, igniting targets in a 5m cone in front of you.
Make an Intellect check, targeting the Dodge of creatures in front of you.
If they fail, they take 4d6 hot damage.
If they roll and succeed, that damage is halved.
This effect may cause flammable objects to start burning.
If these objects are on creatures, they can take them out immediately by using 2 AP (not necessarily on their turn, but increasing the AP similar to AP damage).
Being on fire, standing in a flaming area, or moving through a flaming area causes 5 hot damage per AP they spend near the flame.
