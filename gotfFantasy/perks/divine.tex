\chapter{Divine Perks}\label{ch:divinePerks}
This category includes prayers and wonders.\\
A character that has started to follow in the path of divine stewardship will choose a religion created by the GM as their patron.
They can then learn prayers and add them to prayer books.
Then, a character has to remember the prayer from the prayer book, or recite it out of the prayer book.\\
Searching for a prayer in a prayer book takes an amount of AP equal to \frac{1}{10}th of the amount of prayer ranks in the book.\\
For example, a book with 55 prayers in it would take 6 AP to search through.
A character can also remember a number of prayers from a book, which takes 1 hour in total.
The amount of prayers a character can remember at a time is equal to their Intellect, and ignores prayer ranks.\\
This limit is shared between prayers and spells.\\
Prayers require faith to perform.
Once per day at a certain time, which is also called their faith's divine hour, they can restore their faith.
This takes 15 Minutes and only works if they're in possession of their prayer book.
