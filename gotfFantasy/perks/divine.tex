\chapter{Divine Perks}\label{divinePerks}
This category includes prayers and wonders.\\
A character that has started to follow in the path of divine stewardship will choose a religion created by the GM as their patron.
They can then learn prayers and add them to prayer books.
Prayers require faith to perform.
Once per day at a certain time, which is also called their faith's divine hour, they can restore their faith.
This takes 15 Minutes and only works if they're in possession of their prayer book.
