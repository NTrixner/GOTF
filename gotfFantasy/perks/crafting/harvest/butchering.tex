You can use a salvaging knife to butcher parts of a creature's corpse.
Doing so requires a DEX check, and you can add your crafting level as a Skill Bonus to it.
When doing so, the GM compares your check to the Butchering table of the slain enemy.\\
The amount of time it takes to butcher a corpse is based on the size of the creature.
Depending on the condition of the corpse, your check may be reduced, or some parts of the enemy might not be able to be butchered.\\
