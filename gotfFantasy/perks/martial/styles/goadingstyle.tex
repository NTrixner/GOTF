\section{Goading Style}\label{perk:goadingStyle}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 LP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} CHA 8\\
\textbf{Passive, Repeatable, Source}\\
While having a weapon or shield drawn in this style, any creature that can see you suffers a -2 Distraction Malus on any attack rolls that are not targeting you.
This excludes area of effect damage that includes you (meaning, if the creature would attack multiple targets, and you are one of these targets, all targets are attacked normally.)\\
