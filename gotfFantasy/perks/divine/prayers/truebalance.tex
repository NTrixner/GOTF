Pray for 4 and 4 Faith AP and choose a creature that you can see.
You can reduce your own health 2D6, healing the target creature by the rolled amount.
Or you can deal 2D6 necrotic damage to the target creature, and heal yourself by the dealt damage.
If the target creature isn't willing, make a Charisma check against the target's willpower.\\
If your check is below the target's lower willpower, the effect fails.
If the target creature makes a willpower check and succeeds, the damage dealt to them and healed by you, or the healing they receive - but not the damage you took - is halved.
