\section{Prayer of Smiting}\label{prayer:smiting}
\textbf{Cost:} 200 LP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Disciple of Air, Chaos, Death, Destruction, Evil, Earth, Fire, Good, Law, Life, Protection, and Water\\
\textbf{Active, Prayer, Weapon, Repeatable, Source}\\
Pray for 4 AP and pay 5 Faith.
For the next 1d4 of your weapon attacks, any weapon attacks you perform deal an additional 1d8 damage.\\
If the target of the attack is a creature that is diametrically opposed to your faith (see below), you deal 1d10 additional damage instead.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Air opposes Earth
    \item Fire opposes Water
    \item Chaos opposes Law
    \item Evil opposes Good
    \item Protection opposes Destruction
    \item Life opposes Death
\end{itemize}
Creatures fit into the diametrically opposed definition of their faith if they are a member of that faith, are an incarnation of the aspect of that faith (for example, elementals, angels, demons) or their personality and acts reflect that aspect deeply.\\
The extra damage from this prayer does not profit from~\nameref{prayer:divinePower}.
