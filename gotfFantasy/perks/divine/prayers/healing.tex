A creature of your choice in a radius of 15m around you is healed by 2d4.\\
If you target an Undead with this ability, they take the same amount of radiant damage instead.\\
Any creature that wants to resist this effect can do so.
In such a case, make a CHA check targeting their Willpower.\\
If you are above their Higher Willpower or the roll and fail, you deal full damage or heal the full amount.\\
If they roll and win, the damage and healing is halved.\\
If you are below their Lower Willpower, your prayer fails.\\
