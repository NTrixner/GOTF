\section{Sailor}\label{background:sailor}
Leaving the ship's creaking timbers behind, you're a sailor setting sail for new horizons.
Born from the sea's embrace, you heed the call of the open waters.
Whether driven by wanderlust, the pursuit of fortune, or the desire for freedom, your journey weaves tales of salt and wind.

Adventures might be pursued for exotic treasures, charting unexplored waters, or finding camaraderie beyond the ship's crew.
Your seafaring skills and familiarity with maritime life grant you the ability to navigate and survive in diverse coastal and aquatic environments.

Yet, deeper currents could shape your course.
Long-lost maritime legacies, debts to secretive factions, or personal quests for closure might steer your ship.

Your goals encompass the thrill of exploration, the pursuit of riches, forging unbreakable bonds, or even unravelling maritime mysteries.
Adventure becomes your ocean, where you ride the tides of fate and chase the winds of change.
Will you carve your name on the world's watery map, seek your own brand of fortune, or uncover the hidden treasures that lie beneath the waves?
The journey ahead is a voyage that you alone can navigate.
