\section{Description}\label{sec:weaponDescription}
\subsection{Weapon quality}\label{subsec:weaponQuality}
Manufactured weapons can have different qualities.
For example, a dagger might be rusted or a longsword might be masterfully crafted.
The quality of a weapon adds a bonus to attack rolls - this modifier ranges from --3 (broken) to +3 (high mastery craftsmanship).
The quality of a weapon changes its base price:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item -3: Base Price * 1/4
    \item -2: Base Price * 1/3
    \item -1: Base Price * 1/2
    \item 0: Base Price
    \item +1: Base Price * 1.5
    \item +2: Base Price * 2
    \item +3: Base Price * 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiple Damage Types}\label{subsec:multipleDamageTypeWeapons}
Some weapons, like the~\nameref{weapon:mace} have attacks that deal multiple damage types.
Whenever a wielder of such a weapon gains a bonus to weapon damage (for example, from a or a perk like~\nameref{maneuver:brutalAttack}), they can choose which damage type to apply each modifier to.

\subsection{Draw/Sheath Weapons}\label{subsec:sheathWeapons}
Most weapons have a sheath/unsheath descriptor.
This descriptor denotes how many AP it cost to draw and sheath a weapon.
A weapon with a draw/sheath-duration of "None" is considered to be non-sheathable, meaning it has to be carried around in some other way.
Most small-sized weapons have a Draw/Sheath duration of 2AP, medium-sized have a duration of 3AP, weapons that are strapped to one's back have a duration of 5AP, and large and clunky weapons, like shields, have a duration of 7 AP.

\subsection{Scabbards and straps}\label{subsec:scabbards}
In order to carry a weapon sheathed, a character must affix a scabbard or holding strap to their back or belt.
When buying a weapon, this container is considered to be part of the base price.\\
If a weapon can not be sheathed, it is assumed that it does not have a scabbard or holding strap.
