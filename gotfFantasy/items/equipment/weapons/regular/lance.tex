\textbf{Thrust}\\
4 AP, STR to hit, 3m Reach\\

\textbf{Charge}\\
8 AP, STR to hit, 3m Reach\\
3d10 + \sfrac{1}{3}\texttimes STR Piercing Damage\\
When performing a charge, you have to move for 15m in a straight line towards an opponent.
The movement cost for those 15m is already in the AP cost of the charge.
If you have to move further than 15m to reach an opponent, add the additional movement to the AP cost.
