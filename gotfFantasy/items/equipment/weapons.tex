\chapter{Weapons}\label{ch:weapons}
These are weapons that can be bought, their descriptors, their reach, the abilities that can be used for their attack and block rolls, their attack and block actions themselves and their weight and price.\\
\section{Description}\label{sec:weaponDescription}
\subsection{Weapon quality}\label{subsec:weaponQuality}
Manufactured weapons can have different qualities.
For example, a dagger might be rusted or a longsword might be masterfully crafted.
The quality of a weapon adds a bonus to attack rolls - this modifier ranges from --3 (broken) to +3 (high mastery craftsmanship).
The quality of a weapon changes its base price:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item -3: Base Price * 1/4
    \item -2: Base Price * 1/3
    \item -1: Base Price * 1/2
    \item 0: Base Price
    \item +1: Base Price * 1.5
    \item +2: Base Price * 2
    \item +3: Base Price * 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiple Damage Types}\label{subsec:multipleDamageTypeWeapons}
Some weapons, like the~\nameref{weapon:mace} have attacks that deal multiple damage types.
Whenever a wielder of such a weapon gains a bonus to weapon damage (from a species like~\nameref{species:daevana} or a perk like~\nameref{maneuver:brutalAttack}), they can choose which damage type to apply each modifier to.

\subsection{Draw/Sheath Weapons}\label{subsec:sheathWeapons}
Most weapons have a sheath/unsheath descriptor.
This descriptor denotes how many AP it cost to draw and sheath a weapon.
A weapon with a draw/sheath-duration of "None" is considered to be non-sheathable, meaning it has to be carried around in some other way.
Most small-sized weapons have a Draw/Sheath duration of 2AP, medium-sized have a duration of 3AP, weapons that are strapped to one's back have a duration of 5AP, and large and clunky weapons, like shields, have a duration of 7 AP.

\subsection{Scabbards and straps}\label{subsec:scabbards}
In order to carry a weapon sheathed, a character must affix a scabbard or holding strap to their back or belt.
When buying a weapon, this container is considered to be part of the base price.\\
If a weapon can not be sheathed, it is assumed that it does not have a scabbard or holding strap.
