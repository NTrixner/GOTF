\section{Cleric Student}\label{background:clericStudent}
As a young cleric, you've embraced a divine calling that guides your every step.
From sacred texts to the world's embrace, your journey is one of faith and purpose.
Whether inspired by a mentor's teachings or a personal revelation, you navigate the realm with a blend of unwavering devotion and youthful curiosity.

Adventures may be driven by a mission to spread your faith's teachings or to answer a divine command that compels you to explore uncharted territories.
Your divine connection might push you to protect the innocent or to challenge those who threaten the balance between light and darkness.

Yet, questions might linger beneath your outward conviction.
Doubts about your faith's teachings or uncertainty about your place in the divine plan could drive your journey as well.
Alternatively, an old prophecy or an ancient relic could hold the key to your destiny, steering you toward the unknown.

Your goals encompass the dissemination of faith, the embodiment of your deity's will, the protection of the vulnerable, or the resolution of your own inner struggles.
Adventure becomes a spiritual pilgrimage where you're both disciple and guide.
Will you reinforce your convictions, find solace in doubt, or uncover the hidden truths that underlie the realms of gods and mortals?
