\section{Farmer}\label{background:farmer}
Born to the land, you're a farmer or rancher turned adventurer.
Years tilling soil or herding livestock have shaped you.
Torn from the familiar by circumstance or choice, you seek new beginnings.
Perhaps a blight ravaged your fields, forcing you to seek a solution in distant lands.
Alternatively, a longing for adventure stirred your heart, propelling you beyond the boundaries of your homestead.

Driven by the need to protect your community, you use your practical skills to provide sustenance on the road.
Or the allure of untamed wilderness has beckoned you, where you adapt your agricultural expertise to thrive in uncharted territories.
Yet, hidden motivations could underlie your journey - a longing to escape a mundane life, a debt that can't be repaid by crops alone, or even a whispered family legend of buried treasure.

Your aspirations might range from reclaiming lost lands to embracing the thrill of the unknown.
Adventure becomes a new field to cultivate, a chance to prove farming's resilience extends beyond crops.
Will you sow the seeds of camaraderie among your fellow adventurers, or is your quest a solitary endeavor, mirroring the solitary life you once led?
