Beyond that, darkness still prevails.
The Orb is the size of your hand, and you can control its position telepathically.\\
When doing so, it can move 1m every AP.
You can do this in addition to your other actions.\\
However, it can not move further away than 30m from you.
You can decide the colour of the orb and change it at any time. \\
Keeping the Orb of Light up costs 1 Mana per 10 Minutes.
