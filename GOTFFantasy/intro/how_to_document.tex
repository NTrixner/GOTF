\section{How to use this document}\label{sec:howtouse}
In the following chapters, this document explains how to create a GOTF-based system.
It first describes the base mechanic, as well as how to adjudicate actions, handle rounding, modifier types, etc.
It then goes over the base components of a GOTF-based system - Game Modes, Attributes, Perks, Origins and Inventory.
To a large extent, most of these systems do not provide fixed numbers or strong guidelines.
The reason for that is that the GOTF is designed to work with different levels of power-fantasy.
The balancing of numbers is left to the GM.
