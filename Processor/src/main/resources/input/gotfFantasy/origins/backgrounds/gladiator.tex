\section{Gladiator}\label{background:gladiator}
In the heart of the arena, you're a gladiatorâ€”a living embodiment of combat.
Now, driven by aspirations of glory, freedom, or a loftier calling, you venture beyond the familiar battlegrounds.
Your combat prowess, honed through countless clashes, becomes your steadfast companion as you navigate the uncharted territories of adventure.

The thrill of the roaring crowd echoes in your veins as you face new challenges, each distinct from the predictable rhythm of the arena.
The call of fame may beckon, promising to amplify your renown beyond the walls that confined you.
Alternatively, shackles forged by debts or allegiances might direct your path towards perilous quests, pushing you to seek fortunes and favor.

As you step onto the broader stage of adventure, you can strive to etch your name among legends, yearn to unshackle yourself from the chains of servitude, or wield your formidable combat abilities to prove your mettle to the world.
The tales that unfurl are unscripted, leaving you at the crossroads of fate.
Will you be a reluctant participant in someone else's machinations, or will you seize control of your narrative, carving a path that transcends the blood-soaked sands of the arena?
