\section{Half-Elves}\label{species:half-elves}
Half-Elves are the result of a relationship between a human and an elf.
Oftentimes, this results in them feeling not very at home in either of those two societies.\\
Half-Elves mature at the age of 18, at which point their aging slows down, and they can reach up to 250 years of age.\\
At their best, Half-Elves are open, friendly and charismatic.\\
At their worst, they are reclusive, sad and jealous.\\
Half-Elves start with a \textbf{Racial Bonus to Charisma of +2} as well as a \textbf{Racial Bonus of +1 to a different active Attribute}.\\
As part of their elven heritage, they also gain a \textbf{Racial Bonus of +1d6 against effects that would put them to sleep}.\\
Half-Elves start the game with 25 Health, 20 Stamina, 25 Mana and 20 Faith.
