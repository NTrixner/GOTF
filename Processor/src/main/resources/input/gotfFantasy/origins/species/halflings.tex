\section{Halflings}\label{species:halflings}
Halflings are a very short species of nimble humanoids that enjoy the company of other Species, but also often have their own enclaves to call home.\\
Halflings mature at the age of 36, and live to be around 200.\\
At their best, Halflings are friendly, curious and open-minded.\\
At their worst, Halflings are naive, intrusive and dishonest.\\
Every Halkaran starts with a \textbf{Racial Agility Bonus of +2}.\\
Also, Halflings have a \textbf{Racial Dexterity Bonus of +1}\\
However, every Halkaran suffers a \textbf{Racial Strength Malus of -2}.\\
Halflings are known to have a built-in ability when it comes to throwing things accurately.
Many people have suffered head fractures from Halkaran-thrown stones over the ages.
This means that \textbf{Halflings gain a +1d4 Racial Bonus to attack rolls made with throwing weapons.}\\
Additionally, Halkaran's Luck is a winged word. \textbf{A Halkaran can reroll one Natural 1 on a d20 every 24 hours}.\\
Their small size allows them to sneak better.
They \textbf{gain a +1d4 Racial Bonus to not being noticed.}\\
Halflings start the game with 25 Health, 25 Stamina, 20 Mana and 20 Faith.
