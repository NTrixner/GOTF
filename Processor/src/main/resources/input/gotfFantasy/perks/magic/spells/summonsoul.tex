\section{Summon Soul}\label{spell:summonSoul}
\textbf{Cost:} 250 LP\\
\textbf{Requirements:}~\nameref{spell:bindSoul} I\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source, Upkeep}\\
The spell costs an amount of Mana depending on Soul Shard size (See below)\\
\\
You summon for 4 AP and a certain amount of Mana to summon forth the soul trapped in one of your soul shards.\\
The summon keeps the form and statistics it had in life, but it gains the Etherealness descriptor and its Damage Reduction against Blunt, Cutting and Piercing is replaced by values depending on their Soul Shard Size (See below).
The summon follows your mental commands, but you can only command it if you're able to perceive it.
It is at full health every time it is summoned.\\
If the creature had equipment while dying, it is adorned with ethereal copies of the equipment it had on its body directly before death (e.g.if the creature was disarmed and then killed before it could pick this weapon up again, the ethereal creature doesn't have that weapon).
The summon stays for up to 10 minutes, or until it is slain.
If it is slain, the soul shard shatters and ceases to function.\\

\subsection{Variation: Summon Familiar}\label{spell:summonFamiliar}
\textbf{Cost:} 250 LP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} ~\nameref{spell:bindSoul}\\
When casting Summon Familiar instead of Summon Soul on a soul shard, you do not summon it.
Instead, you bind the soul to become your familiar.\\
From then on, whenever you summon that soul, it can deliver melee spell attacks, and spells which require you touching someone or something, instead of you.
However, doing so costs 2 AP, and you have to concentrate on the spell until the Familiar acts.
It uses your statistics to deliver melee spell attacks.\\
You can also spend 1 to 5 Mana per Minute - depending on the Soul Shard Size - to enter a trance and perceive anything that the Familiar perceives.\\
The Familiar follows your mental commands, and the soul it is bound to is not shattered when it dies.\\
Instead, if a familiar dies, your Maximum Mana is reduced by the amount you paid to summon it.\\
This reduction lasts for 10 days, and you can not bind a new soul to be your familiar until then.\\
When you cast Summon Familiar on another soul while having a familiar, the first loses its status as familiar, and the new soul becomes your familiar.\\
