\section{What the GOTF is}\label{sec:gotfexplanation}
For many, following a predefined ruleset is the easiest solution when it comes to TTRPGs.
There have been many more or less successful systems in the past, and there is something for most flavors.
It is not the target of the GOTF to replace these systems, and we don't espouse to be an \lq end all be all \rq system for every single player out there - that would be arrogant.\\
Instead, the target of the GOTF is to take a setting-gnostic system (called RLP, the Ragged Lands Pen and Paper System), which was designed by the author of this document, and make it more generalized, so it can fit many different worlds, flavors and aesthetics.\\
The GOTF is a meta-system designed to make it easy to create, modify and share RPG Rules Systems.\\
It is based around a single Core Mechanic - the roll of a D20 plus modifiers, but adds multiple systems on top of that, while being completely modular.\\
The basics of a GOTF system are: Game Modes, Attributes, Perks, Origins, and Inventory.
We will go into more detail regarding these entities in the following chapters.\\
This document is not designed for beginners, and not for people who just want a simple RPG System they can pick up and try out.
For that, try the file \lq GOTF\_Fantasy.pdf \rq", which is a GOTF-based rules system designed for simple fantasy adventures - think of your generic humans, elves, dwarves etc.
